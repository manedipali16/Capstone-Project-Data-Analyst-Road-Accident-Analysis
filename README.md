Capstone Project Data Analyst: Road Accident Analysis
Project description: India has the highest number of road fatalities in the world.
In 2016, for which global figures are available, India accounted for more than a third of global
road accident deaths. The World Health Organization says such deaths are under-reported and
estimated that in 2016, the figure for India was likely twice as big as that reported by the
government.
In this project, perform a detailed statistical data analysis on Road Accidents of India over a
period of 2003 to 2016 years using various Python Libraries.
The relevant data supporting for the analysis is available as listed below,
DF - Analysing Accidents per Lakh Population-State-Year.
DF1 - Analysing Offender and Victim Deaths per Gender, State.
DF2 - Analysing Deaths occurred due to improper use of Safety Accessories.
DF3 - Analysing rate of accidents from the year 2003 to 2016 for each state.
DF4 - Analysing accidents/injuries/deaths occurring as per number of lanes.
DF5 - Analysing accidents/injuries/deaths occurring due to various faults/reasons.
DF6 - Analysing accidents/injuries/deaths as per the types of vehicles.
DF7 - Analysing number of accidents which take place as per time of occurrence.
and the exact names of the files for the above data description are,
df = roadAccStats13-16.csv
df1 = Details_of_road_accident_deaths_by_situation_state_2014.csv
df2 = Persons_killed_due_to_Non-use_of_Safety_Device_2016.csv
df3 = datafile.xls - total number of accidents from 2003 to 16 per state.
df4 = laneAccidents.csv
df5 = reasonOfAccident.csv
df6 = typeOfVehicle.csv
df7 = timeOfOccurence.csv
These data files are available in a Data Base folder, which will be shared with you.

With your analysis, you must answer to the below questions either in a statistical analysis or in a
graphical representation using python code snippets.

2. Mean Accidents per 1L population for each year.
3. The highest number of accident states and least number of accident states.
4. Offenders and victims who died according to gender as well the as the total deaths.
5. Percentage of Deaths occurring due to non-wearing of helmets between male and
female.
6. The number of accidents happening per state from the year 2003 to 2016.
7. Number of ACCIDENTS for 1,2,3,4 LANE per 1L population of resp. state.
